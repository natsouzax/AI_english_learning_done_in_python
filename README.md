**Review.IA** is an AI-powered English learning application developed in Python, focused on vocabulary acquisition through **interactive flashcards and knowledge testing**.

This project was created as an **academic MVP** and was **presented at regional scientific symposiums and academic events**, demonstrating the practical application of Artificial Intelligence in education.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal of Review.IA is to support English learners by combining:
- AI-generated learning content  
- Active recall through quizzes  
- A simple and intuitive study flow  

The project bridges **AI, education, and software engineering** into a functional learning tool.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters an English word  
2. The system generates:
   - Definition
   - Usage example
   - Synonyms and antonyms  
3. The learner reviews the content using flashcards  
4. A short quiz is generated to test understanding  

This flow reinforces learning through **exposure + validation**.
